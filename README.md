# Cycling through the Seasons

The following repository contains the code I utilized to gather and analyze Citi Bike bike-sharing data. 
The data can be found on the [Citi Bike](https://www.citibikenyc.com/system-data) website. 
For this project I utilized all available trip history data from launch through December 2019.

My narrative about the project can be found [here](https://nycdatascience.com/blog/student-works/searching-for-seasonality-citi-bike-trip-history-analysis/)

Analysis:

Scripts:
